|  AN F311 PRINCIPLES OF AERODYNAMICS                      | Pardha Saradhi Gurugubelli Venkata | Pros: -Great course content and good textbook -Teaching is good and decent grading(av around high B-) Cons: -Course content may be a bit hard at beginning due to a lot of physics and math based understanding being required -Prof often cancel/shortens classes (might just be a case for our batch) so make sure to ask him to cover the required syllabus( if you actually find the subject interesting and want to learn more) Evaluation: -Apart from the usual mid and Compre there are also assignments and Projects which are mostly lite -Make sure to attend classes as prof often forgets to send notices regarding assignments and such                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

He also uses a stepwise approach to develop the concept. He correlates the function of the particular system and then logically deduces why that should be true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Syllabus involves basic biology that is generally a part of NCERT class 11 and 12 syllabus. The professor is very knowledgeable and taught very well. Very approachable about doubts. Even though it was an online sem, evaluatives were well spaced out and fair. Easy to get a B with minimal effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  BITS F110 ENGINEERING GRAPHICS                          | Y Venkat Daseswara Rao .           | This is a compulsory course during the first year. It's a topic you either get, or don't get. I was a part of the latter, and didn't have great visualization skills. In that case, solving the textbook helps a lot. Attend tutorials and labs: they are usually graded. Most professors do not teach anything during the course. Manas Patnaik's youtube tutorials will carry you throughout the course. I think grading varies greatly acc to the IC. YVD was my tut instructor, the IC has left our college.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Easy to grasp if you have the fundamentals (although I didn't enjoy it very much). You should know how to read tables accurately and not make silly mistakes, that's very important. I Sreedhar was the IC, his lectures were mid. Most people attended Jeevan Jaidi- I would recommend the same. The tutorials and assignments were well spaced and doable. Exams were kinda bad, but it was an online sem. I think we got a B- or C on average.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  BITS F232 FOUNDATIONS OF DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS | Lalita Bhanu Murthy Neti .         | As with any course offered by Bhanu sir, quite math intensive. However, sir's teaching style is really good and he focusses on ensuring concept clarity of the students. Gives you a pretty good foundation of linear and polynomial regression algorithms as well as basic probability related tools required in this field. Sir gives an introduction to data mining at the end as well. Grading is usually on the better side. Exams are again math/derivation based but if you have attended classes regularly it should not be as hard. Based on my experience of taking 3 Bhanumurthy sir courses, the midsem is usually quite hard and the compre relatively more high scoring. Assignment is usually implementing linear/polynomial regression on the given dataset from scratch using python numpy and pandas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The slides are good and informative if you want to know more about the subject. Although the slides had a lot of math and theory, he asked application-based questions which I personally felt was better than rote learning. However, as the answer key was very unclear and had no precise answer in some places, the marking became dependent on his mood for some questions, so the paper was a double-edged sword. A lot of evaluations were also mood-based (personally speaking). Also not an easy guy to discuss with. tldr; take if you really like the contents of the course                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The classes from the professor were engaging as well. We had to do a course project for which I suggest you ask the professor how he wants it done. The textbook and PYQs were enough for all the evaluatives we had.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  BITS F314 GAME THEORY AND ITS APPLICATIONS              | Vivekananda Mukherjee              | This course is taught by an Eco Department Professor and there usually are surprise quizzes for the course, so you need to attend the classes. The subject matter is actually interesting if you look stuff up on your own so I suggest you do that. Either that or the Textbook recommended and doing PYQs before evaluatives will suffice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  BITS F385 INTRO TO GENDER STUDIES                       | Tony Sebastian                     | If you enjoy thinking critically and having thought-provoking, indulging discussions in the classroom, where the prof is not "teaching" you but rather making you question your knowledge of society, norms and gender itself, then this course is for you. There are no slides, and attending lectures is pretty much essential. The prof does upload a brief summary of each lecture and provides reading materials on cms. Apart from midsem and compare, evals consisted of a take-home assignment of two subjective questions and a post-mids quiz.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  BITS F463 CRYPTOGRAPHY                                  | G Geethakumari .                   | It was an interesting course. I didn't like the way ma'am taught it, as it was taught fast and in a rushing manner, but the course content was interesting. We were taught how various encryption and decryption algorithms work under the hoods and were expected to carry out the looong, heavy mathematical computations involved in the algorithms during the mids and compre. Regarding grading, I was in B- until PCT and was able to pull it to A with the help of compre just because I did the PYQs. So, solve enough questions before the exam if you want a good grade. There was also an assignment and a project as part of the evaluation scheme. The assignments were doable if you have basic programming skills, they were related to the course content. However, the project was only remotely related to the course content and was majorly related to Blockchain Development. Overall, I'd recommend this course if someone is interested in Cryptography or if someone is looking forward to a course that guarantees them a good grade (if you're dedicated enough to solve PYQs xD)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Is very unapproachable regarding evaluation components, but approachable if you want to discuss about the subject. Doesn't teach nearly as well as Prof. Bhanumurthy and overworks you with a project and few assignments (They're useful to learn ML practically). Has good mid sem grading (B/B- at average).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Sir went into depth with all mathematical derivations throughout the course, leading to very math-intensive classes. The topics covered include Naive Bayes Classification, Logistic Regression and Gradient Descents, Fishers Linear Discriminant, Perceceptron, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (Artificial Neural Networks with Backpropagation). The examinations were straightforward and high-scoring, whereas the project/assignment work, though simple, aided in understanding the models through the process of making them from scratch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Mid sem grading was okaish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

You will have to do the learning entirely on your own. Her grading is normal, nothing sadistic in that area. Her projects are also fine but you'll have to do everything entirely from scratch, she and her TAs are not much help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The grading was also decent. The only problem is she doesn't know how to teach. She cancels half the classes and then speedruns in the classes she does take.

So, it is a fundamental course, and I advise you not to skip a class. Chandu makes the course very interesting, and the way he explains the concepts is superb! You will crave his teaching once you get into his rhythm. Some may feel he spoon feeds you everything, but it's okay to forget all these things for this one course and enjoy learning and understand the beauty of structures!! PS Grading is also good.

|  CHE F421 BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING                        | Debirupa Mitra                     | Ma'am teaches well and gives access to all the slides (but that doesn't mean you bunk; there are no recordings in that classroom and her explanations are important). The thing is, you need to use the tools (her teaching and her slides) well - revise, practice, learn. In mids I failed to do that and screwed up, but was able to make up for that after mids with some effort. Grade B is given on avg and is not hard to secure - just don't slack off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  CS F211 DATA STRUCTURES & ALGO                          | Lalita Bhanu Murthy Neti .         | The course seemed to be evenly paced and covered the handout thoroughly. The labs were very helpful in understanding the course material and application. Their being evaluative forced us to actually focus on the application as well since the course under Dr. Bhanumurthy was highly mathematical/theoretical and less application-based. The combination of the two made the course an enjoyable experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The project was not very complicated, nor was it impressive enough to add in our resumes, pretty much a waste of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

He uses only the black board and he proceeds to delete slides and uploads a different set of slides on to cms. Then in the end he'll say slides are not for reference purposes. If you get this prof, use impartus slides and preferable attend classes and refer textbook.

The assignments were also interesting and related to the course material. Unfortunately, due to a certain batchmate, Sir was not able to complete all of the course material, and we were left with only half the complete course during the comprehensive examination, so Sir does tend to be a bit slow at times in covering the material, but everything will be covered in an easy to understand fashion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  CS F222 DISCR STRUC FOR COMP SCI                        | Venkatakrishnan Ramaswamy          | The course is supposed to build a base for later CS Courses. However, Sir seemed to be engrossed with the first chapter; Sets and Relations, and stuck to it for the first 3.5 months of the semester, and then proceeded to complete every other important topic in just 4 classes. At one point, it was multiple chapters getting over in one class. He does not like listening to reason and does things according to his understanding only. An admirable aspect is his intolerance of plagiarism and strict penalties if people are found plagiarizing, be it among students or from external websites. He will use his software to compare and contrast the codes of all students/groups and find the ones with a high plagiarism percentage, so do be wary of that and complete assignments within your group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Dude spent 10 classes on one chapter in the beginning which was literally set theory with extra steps. By the end he was speedrunning entire chapters in under one lecture, a remarkable feat if you disregard the fact that no one understood anything. Grading wasn't bad but average was pretty high.

What made it worse was the professor involved, who already had highly theoretical papers and pointless examinations. There is no plus side to this memorization-based course, and should be removed from the curriculum, unfortunately, it's a CDC, but at least it's only 2 credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The guy is a Java simp. Can you imagine he asked a Java AWT question in POPL Compre. His papers are the worst. Too easy and focused more on rote learning. Sky high averages (usually 75% of the course total). The guy reduces the no of A/A- from midsem to compare. Sneks in slides. If you want to do a project under him (don't) u have to attend all his classes because he takes attendance in every class manually. Just do PYQs for the sake of grades and you will be fine. Overall, an absolute waste of time course.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

You have to mug up a lot of algorithms and run those algos manually in the paper. As for the DRL part you have to differentiate the loss function and do manual back propagation. Many ppl do calculation mistakes and paper is very very lengthy. No where to practice questions from, and sir doesnâ€™t upload slides. You have freedom to choose your project, but you will lose marks if it isnâ€™t good.

Doesn't share slides. His papers are basically filled with calculations on manually implementing taught algorithms but there are no equivalent problems to practice so it comes down to your ability to understand. The project was good as we were given almost infinite freedom, resume worthy. Overall it was one of the better courses if you are willing to put in some time attending classes and self studying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  CS F320 FOUNDATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE                     | Lalita Bhanu Murthy Neti .         | The course is oriented toward understanding mathematical reasoning behind many Data Science and Data Engineering concepts like Bayesian Regression, Regularized Regression, Principle Component Analysis, etc. Evaluations include surprise quizzes which are mostly just simple questions from the same class (you are allowed to use phones and ask your friends, so this is mostly attendance marks :D ), 2 assignments, which are fairly easy, and a lab component (i cant understand why this was necessary). Mids and compre mostly include direct questions and derivations from class, so class notes help a lot although some questions might be tricky or based on a fundamental understanding of Probability Theory, Linear Algebra. All in all, a fun course with normal grading (B- at av) which honestly helps you learn some good and important concepts in Data Science.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

As long as you attend class and understand class proofs, it should be easy. But average is very high.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  CS F320 FOUNDATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE                     | Lalita Bhanu Murthy Neti .         | Quite a math-heavy course, very akin to the Machine Learning course, if taken by the same prof. Positives: The explanation is very good. Sir teaches as if he's explaining to a '7th Class Student'. The depth covered in each topic taught is great. The course has a direction, that is Regression Models, so it doesn't branch out around trying to cover too much in too less time. Assignments are basically free marks thrown at you, so could be a good or a bad thing. Negatives: The course gets stagnant at a point. After half of the lectures I felt a lack of connect with the same kinda of math I had enjoyed initially. The exams are just based off the notes, so the averages will be very high. Overall you have to do this course if you took a DS Minor, but even otherwise its a decently enjoyable class, which ends up teaching you at least something practical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

They gave lab tests where very few people actually managed to get the answer, and the pattern of quiz papers was unclear until the end.

This was a course which had an average of 30 out of 120 and he increased to around 48. compre correction was one more fuck up. I can clearly see my answer is correct but the guy argues it's wrong and am not on campus. i hope he doesn't get any course ever again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The material was complete and served to create a good base which the quizzes, examinations, and labs solidified. Unfortunately, there were mishaps throughout every single evaluation due to the instructor in charge and his miscommunications with the Ph.D. TAs, FD TAs, and other professors involved in the course, making it an incredibly painful experience to go through.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

He is confused while teaching , constantly keeps teaching wrong things then corrects himself 20 minutes later. Every evaluation component had some or the other problem the worst being giving marks for a question only if all subparts were exactly correct (+12/+0). His teaching slides are just pictures taken from the textbook and compre paper questions were picked up from some foreign University paper. Asked problems on topics he hasn't even mentioned but "was in the books so you should have known". Easily the worst experience I've had with an ic and a course. Avoid courses taken by him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|  CS F351 THEORY OF COMPUTATION                           | Raghunath Reddy Madireddy          | One of the best profs in the CS dept. He taught the course in an easy to understand and thorough manner. His lectures were engaging and well-paced. He stuck the syllabus properly, even doing multiple problems for proper understanding. Completed all portions on time and examinations had questions from his lectures (something which is somehow becoming increasingly difficult for other profs). Overall it was a good course and built excellent foundations on automata theory and languages, which are core parts of computer science.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The slides shared were very thorough. The assignments were helpful in understanding the material, however, the scoring for all assignments was incredibly lenient and the comprehensive examination was incredibly easy, with an average of 95+ out of 120. This led to the entire course being decided based on the midem examination alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Till midsems its basically search algorithms based on every creature that exists like ant/squirrel/cuckoo etc etc. One part of the course deals with propositional and predicate logic thus CS students have a slight advantage (15 marks in midsem and 15 in compre were for this in a 200 marks course). Post mids he thought Bayesian Belief Networks , Fuzzy Inference systems and brushed over supervised and Unsupervised learning. Basically you will get an idea on every topic but will not go in too much depth. Lite course in my opinion and can score good if followed his lectures. Overall the guy is a cutie!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|  CS F407 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE                         | J Jabez Christopher                | First part of course was slightly boring for me as it contained various search algorithms such as dfs,bfs and then moving onto ant-colony optimization and particle swarm optimization. But then it picks up speed with various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques such as naive bayes, knn, k-means clustering, decision trees, information theory etc as well as an intro to fuzzy information systems. At the end it concludes with an intro to image processing and case-based reasoning. Second part of the course was more interesting for me but the comprehensive exam was quite length, however the correction was quite lenient. Wasn't very fond of sir's teaching style but overall the course and its logistics were good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The grading is also decent and the project if done properly is resume worthy and helps get a good grasp of concepts by applying them practically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Also his voice drones on and on & just very boring classes in general. Grading wise, he gave B at av+8 but gave very few As. There is 1 project throughout the sem with midsem and compre evaluation. It's lite if you put in the most basic effort.

Pyqs are also quite helpful. Start of the course is an extension of backpropagation and ANNs taught in ML and latter part is an introduction to Reinforcement Learning which is sir's field of research as well. Second half of the course is quite math intensive starting with CNNs and RNNs but moving on to more complex architectures and then performing backpropagation on them. Midsem grading was decent with B given at approx av + 4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  CS F429 NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING                     | Aruna Malapati .                   | Very nice course, grading might be mid considering she doesn't really improve grading in compre in comparison to mids. Course has a lot of content, and it's very dynamic and apt with the current scenario. we had full post mids based on prompt engineering. Her papers are mostly related to what she teaches in class and they don't cross that. She expects us to understand rather than remember content (sort of). Compre and mids will be based on architectural designs and theory. pyqs are sufficient for this course if you attend classes regularly. The project is very good too. It's open ended and is not fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  CS F429 NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING                     | Aruna Malapati .                   | A decent course to get an intro into NLP, but not practical-oriented. Most of the scoring can be done by memorising the slides, and there isn't much the course offers to you if you don't like studying that way. The project will teach you a lot about the field, since you're at your own discretion to choose the problem statement. In summary, its fine, not something you'd like to rave about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Ma'am covers a lot of content but most of it is easy so you can get a good grade if you attend classes and study for a day or two before the exam. The projects(assignments) ma'am will give are pretty good, and you can put atleast one of them on your resume. Grading is standard CS grading at B- at av.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  CSECEEEEINSTR F215 DIGITAL DESIGN                       | R N Ponnalagu                      | The course was very logical throughout, with very little of it needing memorization. The concepts of all the logic gates, latches, and sequential circuits were clearly taught. The lab seemed pointless, as all you had to do was join wires, but that was quite enjoyable and relaxing in some ways. The papers were tough and required heavy logical reasoning and application, with most questions requiring you to build appliances/tools using the minimal amount of given resources(Muxes, encoders, latches, clocks, etc). The grading was incredibly easygoing, and the course was an enjoyable experience on the whole.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  CSECEEEEINSTR F215 DIGITAL DESIGN                       | R N Ponnalagu                      | The course was very logical throughout, with very little of it needing memorization. But with this came its set of challenges as well. We had 5 quizzes of 10 marks over the sem which turned out to be a nightmare for me as all 5 questions (2 marks each) were interconnected so if u get something slightly wrong wrong very high chance of getting all wrong. Even the midsem was really really hard. The papers were tough and required heavy logical reasoning and application, with most questions requiring you to build appliances/tools using the minimal amount of given resources(Muxes, encoders, latches, etc). The lab seemed pointless at the end, as all you had to do was join wires and none of the verilog programming we did in the regular labs was used in the lab test. Ma'am teaches quite well but is quite strict and may not be the easiest to approach. The grading was quite good in the end though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I think he gave about 110 (As and A-s) combined. his papers I feel are messed up cause they involve small bits and even if you mess up one part you might end up losing everything cause it's more like they are fill in the blanks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The concepts by themselves were not very hard, but there was a lot of confusion around them because of various sources of information stating different concepts. The IC was very helpful, but himself had no idea about what was right or wrong and claimed the subject was not his area of expertise or interest. The other professor, Dr. Runa, claimed that the intel handbook was incorrect when it came to a doubt on a microprocessor created by intel. If you understood DD, the course will be a piece of cake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

An interesting subject, he teaches and revises everything from scratch that is needed for the course. Past year papers are really effective in scoring well for this course. The questions are similar to what he has asked in previous years. And daily attending classes are free marks, we had a really easy exit test at the end of each class.

I don't think anyone would teach it better. But he is very old school with his rules, and is just a SADIST. He will make you suffer at least once in the sem with his evals/classes etc. I think the course is very nice. The syllabus is HUGE, so study in advance, don't rely on 1 day before compre.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

They cut off the topics right when it gets interesting with the applications, and move on to a new topic :( Pray you don't get this man for this course. Lab is a menace. You are confused, others are confused, the outputs arent matching, and you just end up copying, just to die during the lab exam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  ECEEEEINSTR F242 CONTROL SYSTEMS                        | Harish Vijay Dixit                 | One of the very few professors I have seen who really knows how to teach stuff. Since he is a bit old school and strict, most of the students preferred Joyjit (very lite and fun teacher) but man, if you really want to understand the subject in a disciplined classroom, choose him. He doesn't follow the stupid slides way of teaching. He writes everything on the screen for 10-15 mins , asks you to just listen when he is teaching, and then note it down when he stops and clears doubts. The only con being some long extra classes on Sundays :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  ECEEEEINSTR F424 SMART GRID FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY      | Pratyush Chakraborty               | The topic itself is still being researched on and the course is also modelled without a textbook and follows research papers. It is very math heavy and requires some knowledge of powe systems and game theory which were taught in class as it was mostly taken by 3rd year students. The grading is very fair and you can get an easy A by going to classes and just listening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

His teaching is very boring, so it'll be best for you if you find some good tutor on youtube and do all PYQs. You don't need to attend his classes but follow along with all the course material he uploads on CMS, and study them diligently. Questions most commonly come from those. Don't argue with him if you think you got a question right but he has marked it wrong, he'll just deduct marks from other questions to make up for adding marks on your query.

|  ECON F215 COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR ECON                | Rishi Kumar                        | The course was very interesting and focused on finding out the importance of various variables/factors and the effect they have on our target variables. Unlike machine learning, wherein we simply try to improve the accuracy of our prediction, the goal of this course is to help us understand what would happen on changing one factor, and what factors to control and what not to control when seeing the difference. The professor was very friendly and helpful at all times, very clear with what he wanted to teach and explain, and cleared all the doubts properly. You might have a slight issue if you're not comfortable with Hindi, but Sir will make sure to repeat everything in English as well if there's a large class strength uncomfortable with Hindi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  ECON F242 MICROECONOMICS                                | Vivekananda Mukherjee              | The course is an extension of Principles of Economics and a more detailed version of it. It helps you understand various actions of consumers based on budgets, changes in prices and incomes, and preferences. The course also deals with interactions in a two-person and two-commodity environment, which has its own concepts and rules. The second half of the course has to do with the behavior of firms in markets and monopolies. The course itself is pretty simple to understand, but the professor wasn't very clear with what he wanted to say or elaborate on, often getting confused by doubts. The paper that he set was also pretty tough, with questions on topics he wasn't very clear on while teaching. The slides he provided alongside the problem sets were sufficient for understanding the course, but a 30% surprise quiz component made classes a necessity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Coming to the post-mid part, Prof. Bharandev convoluted basic stuff and set a really hard compre paper (for which the average was 32/80, even with a 20 mark crossword and a 20 mark OB component) which felt like a different paper altogether when compared to the previous sem's paper. DO NOT mess up the OB component by burning through time in the CB component under any circumstance when it comes to compre as it is usually really easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  ECON F355 BUSS ANAL & VALUATION                         | Shravani Bharandev                 | The course is good and has a lot of detail. You'll learn many different methods of valuation as well as accounting portions such as income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements. There are usually 3 quizzes and an assignment well spread out over the course. Grading is normal, average at B-. The only negative part of this course was the post- midsem portion taught by Prof. Shravani Bharandev. She teaches in a very confused manner, doesn't do calculations accurately even while reading from her laptop during lectures and even the Excel sheets she uploads as problem solutions or quiz/midsem/compre solutions have mistakes pretty often.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

You need not put efforts for the course and grading is also good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Public policy is also a minimalistic course, so you won't have to ratta a lot of things too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The grading is not at all bad compared to other HuEl's and getting a B is pretty easy if you are consistent with submissions. The course involves a major project component, in which you will be given a case study. Choose the case study and work sincerely on it. You will have 2 submissions. The midsem submission will be a presentation on the same case study, and the Compre submission will involve writing a screenplay and enacting it. The professor - Harsh Mittal was very helpful throughout the duration of the course and you can mail him if you have ANY queries. He replies to mails instantly. Overall a great course and you must pursue it if you are genuinely interested in Policymaking processes, general Administration and Politics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

If you just have the confidence to speak in a class of around 80(or even less,as most ppl dont attend) you'll ace this course. No quizzes or midsem, we just have speeches. Prof is the most open minded and kind and grading is also very chill. Although we cant guarantee an A , cuz thats the nature of this course...an A- is pretty doable even if you attend 40- 60% of the classes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  GS F245 EFFECTIVE PUBLIC SPEAK                          | Santosh Kumar Mahapatra            | For this course and prof you need to attend classes regularly because the exam tests you on what he does in class. There are no slides or textbooks for reference as such. Also when doing the speeches and other practical components, follow his instructions to a T. Grading was normal. Our midsem was online and compre was offline. He's a chill prof and will engage with you if you have doubts. In general it's a fun class & if you have stage fear, this is a good place to start.

So yea a bit random but still take it, you can focus on other cdcs easily with this course.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Just go through the slides well                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|  GS F333 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION                           | Lavanya Suresh                     | The professor is very passionate with regards to the course, and is very enthusiastic while teaching. The course material covers various important articles from the Indian constitution and the executive structure of the country. It is going to be heavily memorization-based, but interacting with the professor makes it easier to understand. The examinations are direct, so long as you recognize the article numbers and case studies mentioned. There is a clear format for the answers that the professor requires, and she will make it clear to all the students prior to the examination itself, so she makes it clear what she wants in the paper and what she will award marks to. PS Do not speak against reservation in front of her, she gets very unhappy, and in a Group Discussion eval, you may lose a lot of marks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  GS F333 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION                           | Lavanya Suresh                     | The course consists of learning about articles in the Constitution of India building upto the Public Administration framework of the country. Pre midsem is more about basic framework/fundamental rights from the constitution. The course involves a Group discussion evaluative (the only eval component other than mids and compre) where you need to discuss a give statement (usually taken from contemporary public speeches/affairs) and explore how it relates to articles in the constitution and various case laws that can be used to justify/oppose it. The course is fun for people interested in Indian polity and the working of the Indian government but involves lot of mugging up of articles, concepts, case laws and interpretations of the constitution's articles. The mids and compre paper is direct from her slides and lectures so it's easy to score if you attended classes. All in all, interesting and easy course but too much mugging up required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If you want to score high, do attend all the classes, all the papers will be based on the lectures only and you don't need any extra material to prepare. There are no marks for attendance tho. Grading is below average as compared to other humanities.

|  HSS F235 Introductory Philosophy                        | Jayesh A K                         | Can't say much about the professor as I have a grand total of zero interactions with him over the course of a whole semester and 4 evaluative components (went for zero collections too). However, the course material is pretty simple in itself, and the prescribed textbook is an enjoyable read, with comedic relief here and there and interesting examples provided. The course is not one where you get to say your own philosophical bullshit, but instead, one where you have to reiterate popular and already existent theories, so it's slightly rote learning. The midsem and comprehensive examinations had direct questions such as "What were this fellow's arguments against this theory" or "State the principles of this theory".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|  HSS F237 CONTEMPORARY INDIAN ENGLISH FICTION            | Maya Vinai                         | The course content was interesting, maya maam for a fact founded this course and it runs parallely across all 4 campuses. The content is easy but by the time of compres there is so much content that it might be a bit too much from a huel perespective but this is ofc if you've not studied until the day before exam (like most ppl do with huels). Attending a few classes are important, especially the ones before each chapter. Else classes is random fun or maam reading the story so it's skippable. Grading is good, either B at av or B- with B starting right above av (av+1/2/3). Overall really fun course and I enjoyed it. If you like reading it's a must take and if you wanna get into reading then this is a pretty good way to get yourself into it. Will reccomend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  HSS F237 CONTEMPORARY INDIAN ENGLISH FICTION            | Maya Vinai                         | This course is best suited for individuals with strong literary abilities. If you're someone who doesn't attend classes regularly or tends to cram the syllabus just before exams, it may not be the right fit. The course is graded out of 100 marks, and each mark significantly impacts your overall grade, with a potential change of 2 or 3 marks. The mid-semester grading was a bit tough, and the evaluator must appreciate your essay for you to score well. In my opinion, considering other courses might be a better option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The professor is heavily biased towards the people who attend classes and will award extra marks to those whose names she recognizes and will cut for those whose names she does not recognize (from personal experience, my comprehensive paper had multiple places where the marks awarded were cut out and reduced, I lost an A by 1 mark).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  HSS F243 INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL PEDAG                 | Santosh Kumar Mahapatra            | Course is basically about educational methods with a liberal mindset (don't punish, being too oppressive, etc.) The key is to attend classes IN PERSON; a lot of the course is discussion-based and involving exchange of opinions and views on the subject matter in the class. This is not much of an issue; prof is very chill and open to all sorts of opinions. If you manage to get this part right, exams will be a breeze (but if you don't engage, then you might have difficulty figuring out the concept).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  HSS F243 INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL PEDAG                 | Santosh Kumar Mahapatra            | (following up on my previous review) but beware of not attending/interacting. There were a number of people who were toppers in other courses but didn't do too well in this because they figured that they could see the recs and manage. The course entirely depends on the class, not what you do in your room. Grading mostly depends on this - those who attend and interact get A/A-, while others fall in a range from B- to C-.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  HSS F244 CRIME AND NEW MEDIA                            | Anhiti Patnaik                     | Good attendance would easily fetch 8 or 9 Crime and new media is an amazing course, definitely worth taking. a) On av it was 6, i won't say that the grading was chill. Also there are marks for attendence (so keep that in mind). b) We basically discussed in detail about crime using different movies and series. Watching the series/movies was never a necessity but it helped understand the concepts better. The way ma'am designed the course is amazing. If you love crime shows and wanna understand more about the 'villains', take this course. Crime and New Media is a new course, but I can vouch for Anhiti Ma'am's classes. Engaging and Interesting. The exams will be exactly from what she teaches, so if u manage to attend all classes or watch the lectures, you won't need any extra effort for a 8, even 9 won't be hard to get if u attend regularly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  HSS F246 PHILOSOPHY OF NAGARJUNA                        | Jayesh A K                         | About a Buddhist philosopher named Nagarjuna; includes discussions on a number of his philosophical discourses such as how the senses delude us, maya (illusions), etc. As for the prof - he put me to sleep in 10 mins. Escaped in two weeks by swapping, but my less lucky friend concurs that it was this way for the rest of the semester, and adds that the grading is absolute garbage - C on average. If you get it, pray to Nagarjuna to let you through unscathed...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

He was a new prof so probably did bad grading but we'll never find out. I heard he did nice grading next year though. It had open book compre which was not really helpful cause he asked questions from class content over textbook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  HSS F317 INTRO TO GLOBALIZATION                         | Harsh Mittal                       | I took the course when it was introduced for the first time. You need to attend classes for this course in order to get an A/A-. He gives slides but what he tells in class has much more info and nuance. His teaching is all over the place tho, he doesn't tell you clearly what the teaching material is (when he takes examples from articles, papers etc) & that can get very confusing. And the project work which accounts for a major part of your grade is not easy. He will grade you seriously, it's not free marks. Take this course if you are interested in global affairs, have some idea about it & are willing to attend class regularly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  HSS F317 INTRO TO GLOBALIZATION                         | Harsh Mittal                       | The course was pretty interesting. We started with the history and definition of globalization, and then delved into various case studies to understand its different aspects. Sir highlighted the connections between globalization and concepts like food security, health, trade, imperialism and Americanization. We also had a few guest lectures which gave us interesting insights. The classes were interactive and discussions were often shaped by the students' views. Regular attendance is necessary to do well in exams. The project was open-ended, but required effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The material is taught using in depth analysis of reference articles which makes the course interesting. Attending classes will help in scoring during exams since sir is open to discussion and a lot of ideas and perspectives are discussed. Overall, the course will require some effort but includes a lot of interesting readings. Compre grading is decent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  HSS F317 INTRO TO GLOBALIZATION                         | Harsh Mittal                       | Pretty decent course, but if you don't attend classes it's tough to get a 9 or 10. He does give slides and you can buy the textbook but he asks questions from the class discussions and guest lectures that happen in class so the slides are not very useful. The project takes some effort too, and he asks one question directly from the project in midsem and/or compre, which combined with the absence of quizzes give the project pretty high weightage. Grading isn't great, he gave 3 A's which is pretty less for a HuEL. He did absolute grading in both midsem and compre but that will probably not happen again as he did get complaints. Despite all this, the course is pretty interesting and you will get to learn a lot. Overall, decent course but you'll have to put in some effort                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  HSS F318 INTRO TO ANTHROPOLOGY                          | Suchismita Satpathy                | 9.5/10. t's a great course for someone wanting to get an overview of the field of anthropology. Grading is not too bad, with B- at average score and about 10 people getting A in a class of 80-90. Attendance is really helpful for making notes and interaction with the prof helps with improving the scores a lot. Most of the topics in exams are thoroughly discussed in the class, putting you ahead of the people not attending. All the slides are uploaded and applying for makeup is really simple. There is a significant amount of reading in the slides, but none of it is difficult to grasp, Would definitely recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  HSS F318 INTRO TO ANTHROPOLOGY                          | Suchismita Satpathy                | Nice course, going to classes makes a huge difference in the course. She tells the important stuff from the slides and expects mostly what she taught in the class.

The correction is incredibly strict and the teacher expects highly specific answers.The teacher may say that they will accept a broad range of answers considering it is a Hss course ,but ultimately has a very rigid marking scheme. Take only if you are very interested.Attending classes is useful.Swati Alok has a nice methodology of using case studies to explain but is very strict with the marking, she has very specific requirements in the answersheet and doesn't deal with rechecks properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  HSS F331 Sankara's Thoughts                             | Maya Vinai                         | Course is very simple and fun. Dr. Maya Vinai puts in a lot of work to make classes engaging and interesting. You're not expected to learn any Sanskrit since she gives the translations in class. Attending classes is a must, for a lot of questions in the exams come from what she's verbally said in class instead of the slides. The elaboration on slide material is done in class, which is very important to take down as notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  HSS F331 Sankara's Thoughts                             | Maya Vinai                         | Take this if you want a nice, easy DEL. Do not take this if you are a fan of philosophy, or Advaita. You will be left disappointed (and fuming). The professor does not know enough about Advaita to be taking this course. Most of it is about Sankara- as in his biography, rather than Advaita Vedanta. The topics she covers are important. But she makes a lot of errors in interpretation: if you are actually interested in Advaita, stay away. The book she recommends is actually good. Her interpretations are atrocious; the other reviews of this course are positive because it is a lite course, and the prof is friendly. Grading is good. TLDR: Take it if you want an easy B. Run away if you're interested in philosophy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  HSS F335 LITERARY CRITICISM                             | Shilpaa Anand                      | Teaches very well, classes are interactive and grading is fair( B- at average ig). But you'll have to attend classes to understand the subject matter, which is a little tough. Don't expect just reading poems and stories and analyzing them all the time. That's just a little part of the course. It will cover almost all of the history of ideas(moral vs. immoral, art for art's sake, romanticism, etc.) of various authors and critics, starting from the Greeks to the modern era.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Let's go from the basics- (Before u go into the review, it was sir's first time taking the course and he wishes to make it a lot better and add a whole lot of improvements. He genuinely wants to do it better and so I believe the course will be overall much better next time. I did it in 2023-24's odd sem) Also sir's other courses are really good and the students there deff reccomend that so don't feel the same hesitation while taking those 1) The teacher- Well, ppl have very mixed opinions on him. Is he knowledge? Heck yea, dude prolly has too much knowledge and genuine interest in his stuff. Is it something you'll be interested and vibe with? That idk 2) Grading- One word- bad. C- at av in midsems and rn while writing this review the compre grades haven't been announced so idk about that. 3) Course content- The stories/ essays are well......aight. They're fine honestly and aren't as bulky to read as other literature courses like CIEF. But even if u did manage to read it all, and throughly, the Qs asked in exams also seem doable and u think that the paper went well but you ain't getting markins in the paper. Getting marks isn't something that happens in this course. The issue is- "Modern" isn't modern, it's actually pretty ancient hehe. Modernism ends up more of a philosophical topic and the views that sir gives are largely on what he thinks about it and so u can't find it online for self study either. And he doesn't give an answer key for mids or compre, the marks he gives is based on his gut feeling. If he feels that u could have written more then he'll give u less marks. Like we had a 10 mark Q and the class highest was 6.5 or something bruh. He wants more content to fit in that the word limit permits. I've done the course, attended most class and if u ask me what is "modern" , IDFK fr It's just traumatizing and idk other way to tell. Attending classes helps, definitely esp pre mids. Post mids it's just stories so it's minimally useful and the return on attending classes is so marginally low after mids that you wouldn't get the motivation to go for it. Concluding- it ain't the worst out there, but if u can avoid then u better do |

I would suggest please don't take any course of this instructor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The first half of the course was focused on different types of literature with examples, with the second half focusing on a short Indian novel. Attending classes helps a lot (recommended if you are interested in the subject), though it is not necessary. Good grading at average, though it gets slightly harder to get A/A- as many people will have similar scores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  HSS F338 COMPARATIVE INDIAN LIT                         | Vijay Kumar Tadakamalla            | Personally speaking, it was one of the best courses I've ever taken since joining campus. I've enjoyed it immensely. If you are a fan of analyzing and reading texts and in the process learning about the very roots of comparative literature and the need for it, definitely go for it. Sir is extremely qualified, friendly and in my opinion does complete justice to the course. Grading-wise wise it might not seem ideal, he gave a C on average. However, if you go to class regularly and understand the essence of the texts and material he's going through, it should be an easy A or A- since the questions he asks are always directly from the texts and the discussions made in class regarding the same. I recommend you stay away from this course if you do not think it's your cup of tea, as it does require a fair bit of effort from your end. Always choose something you're genuinely interested in! -R                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

However, exams were very much based on rote learning from Sir's lectures so if you can do that then it'll be an easy A. Don't take if you don't plan on attending classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  HSS F340 POST COLONIAL LITERATURE                       | Vijay Kumar Tadakamalla            | Overall a good course. He extensively covers many relevant books, which I personally liked. More than half the paper was objective type in midsem and compre. For assignment 1, we had video submission on some topic taught in class. The second again was an objective type quiz.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|  HSS F346 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS(2)                     | Suchismita Satpathy                | It's an interesting course, especially if you're into history. Ma'am covers various concepts such as liberalism, marxism, realism, constructivism, etc. and applies them to gain an understanding of both the world wars. The questions asked in the exams are directly from the class. You'll have to do some amount of mugging up to answer the questions. Do attend the revision class that ma'am conducts just before the exams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  HSS F346 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS(2)                     | Suchismita Satpathy                | This is one of the best courses I have taken in BITS. You will encounter several theories used in studying international relations, as well as several events from history. The syllabus is vast, but the professor covers it very well. In the first part, you will study several schools of thought in detail- Hobbes, Marx etc. Then you will also learn how to interpret world events using those schools of thought. This is very interesting and non trivial. Towards the end of the course, you will learn in detail either about Indian Geopolitics, or some world event happening currently. Some tips: 1. Attend all classes. Take meticulous notes. This will guarantee a 10 2. Don't forget to attend the final classes. They are important. I don't remember grading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Take this course only if you can attend classes and make your arguments, if you cannot fulfill any of these, avoid it. Overall i liked the course, prof was the nicest i have seen, questions your own thoughts and doesn't follow the orthodoxal method of teaching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The guy teaches in a very unique way and expects everyone to come to classes. he clearly states that he favors those who attend classes. Very careless, did random marking for assignment 1 and didn't even tell us the marks of assignment 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  HSS F361 URBAN POLICY AND GOVERNANCE                    | Harsh Mittal                       | The course is a little hard as you will have to give time to it .You have to give time because it has play also which carries a significant portion (40%). But it is easier to score also because most of them don't show interest. The grading is decent. You will have to attend classes regularly as in exams he asks questions directly from the discussions in the class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  HSS F361 URBAN POLICY AND GOVERNANCE                    | Harsh Mittal                       | Overall the course is nice (only if you wish to attend almost all the classes ),unlike other huels , there is not much of rote memorization but the main pain is the the project or the presentation he asks for ( for us it was a screenplay) other than that just attending the classes and revising the notes before the exam(just 2 or 3 hrs before midsem or compre) would be good , the midsem and compre were quite easy and scoring as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  HSS F361 URBAN POLICY AND GOVERNANCE                    | Harsh Mittal                       | Pretty decent course. You need to go to classes for this course. Mostly content is from articles, and a very few portion is from the textbook. If you go to classes you need not spend a lot of extra time before exams. The classes are also interesting aand engaging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  HSS F361 URBAN POLICY AND GOVERNANCE                    | Harsh Mittal                       | Course is interesting and involves minimal memorization if u go to classes. Screenplay (40%) was well-planned and divided into smaller evaluative components. Studying before midsem and compre was very less (4-5 hours). Grading is decent (Midsem - B at Av+1, A at Av+6).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|  HSS F361 URBAN POLICY AND GOVERNANCE                    | Suchismita Satpathy                | I absolutely hated the teaching methodology used in this course. You're expected to memorise facts and data to reproduce in your exam paper with little discussion or critical thought. Almost every class starts with "this question is for X marks, so note it down". Seriously? Doesn't rote-learning humanities courses defeat their point?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

No quizzes are there,but attending classes will become very important if you want to do well in the stage wise submission of project. Even if we can do just average in midems and compres,the project marks will save you.B- grading at av.

Also you will have to attend all classes as sir gives class activity which have a good amount of weightage. Course content is pretty good if you want to learn how to properly write docs and some top level designing details for real world systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

However, at times, the class does become one sided, with less interaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  MATH F111 MATHEMATICS I                                 | Jhuma Sen Gupta                    | This is a compulsory course during first year. It tests your basics of calculus, as well as introduces the basics of multivariable calculus. I personally found it very easy, and you will too, if you have a mathematical bent of mind. The textbook is very resourceful, but you can attend classes too if you want. Most people prefer to attend SKV. Jhuma ma'am is very knowledgeable and will clear all your doubts, she is a great teacher too. The evaluatives were kinda weird with binary marking- but it was an online sem. Learn to do calculations without errors, especially during the latter part of the course. Grading: Expect a B- or C on average. Jhuma ma'am personally grades much better than the rest of the math dept, but not much can be done in a course where ariund ~1000 students take.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

He puts in so much effort for them including using latex for them. His classes themselves are enough for compres and midsems if you attend nicely. People say TSL > JMJ but I would say JMJ > TSL considering the fact that TSL teaches a lot more theory than JMJ (I mean if you like theory TSL is the best but yeah I wasn't a fan of this course and just wanted grade)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Pay attention to the first part- simplex, it is used throughout the course. Tuts if taken by TAs are useless. Attending class gives all the conceptual clarity you need. Course is a bit competitive because EEE folks also take it.

|  MATH F213 DISCRETE MATHEMATICS                          | A Michael Alphonse .               | Good guy, but has no idea how to teach. Classes are a waste of time. Read the book well, the exams are not that hard too. It's a breeze if you find the other 2nd year courses doable. Make sure you dont do errors, sometimes he does binary marking. Oh, and shit grading. The recurrence relations chapter is very important. The graphs part is easy and scoring. So is the propositional logic part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  MATH F214 ELEMENTARY REAL ANALYSIS                      | Manish Kumar                       | One of the worst profs in the department, I doubt he even knows analysis. Every class begins and ends with the definition of an open set. In case you are a lost soul who stumbled upon this review, don't lose heart: try to read from Understanding Analysis by Abbott to understand. The exercises there are much suited for a beginner. Then you can switch to Rudin. I think grading was typical math grading (B- or C) on average.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  MATH F215 ALGEBRA I                                     | Pratyusha Chattopadhyay            | One of my most favorite courses on campus: it is an introduction to college algebra. The course deals with group theory and ring theory. Ma'am takes ring theory very well, but she doesn't like group theory and it kinda shows. The group theory part is easy, except for Sylow's theorem. The ring theory part you need conceptual clarity. If you read the book and do exercises, the course is a breeze. If you feel less challenged, check out Artin or Aluffi's books :) Grading is one of the best in the department, I think she gives Bs on average                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  MATH F241 MATHEMATICAL METHODS                          | Jaganmohan Jonnalagadda            | This is a CDC. It is kinda of the same flavor as M3. It's not very hard, but it's very easy to make mistakes. Sir teaches very well and clears concepts. But he is kinda slow. It is easy to get lost between concepts, so I suggest attending classes. I remember grading to be typical math grading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  MATH F314 ALGEBRA II                                    | Pratyusha Chattopadhyay            | This is a DEL, and one of the harder ones in math. It is a continuation to the linear algebra studied in M2 and you broadly deal with generalised vector spaces. The content is hard to follow, especially the Galois theory part, and she makes a good effort. Again, it is hard to score. But she grades very well. Notes are better than the book for this course.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  MATH F432 APPLIED STATISTICAL METHODS                   | Farida Parvez Barbhuiya            | The course was well paced and most of the topics in handout were covered. Classes mostly consisted of her writing notes on the board and you copying them (if you do). But the notes were very helpful in studying for the course. The course requires you to memorize decent number of formulae (somewhat like m3) so be ready for that. The evaluations were not very tough but consisted of few tricky questions to keep averages at bay. All in all would recommend taking this course under Farida ma'am for all DS students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  MATH F432 APPLIED STATISTICAL METHODS                   | Farida Parvez Barbhuiya            | The Course structure is very well thought out, to cover concepts of FoDS, ML and Data Mining to an extent. I felt that this was the most comprehensive DS Minor CDC, at least with the breadth of concepts covered. The formula learning, especially towards the very beginning and the very end can be tiresome and boring, but otherwise I enjoyed the classes thoroughly. The teaching is good as well, but there won't be any slides, so you got to deal with attending class and making notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

It's a hard course but when it comes to exams make sure you write as much as possible even if your concepts arent too clear. They're lenient with step marks if you at least try                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

You don't need to delve deep into theory, just make sure you know where the different processes are used IRL and you'll be good for the objective part. Be careful with calculations in the subjective part as there is no step marking. Grading is lite with Av+ fetching you a B.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  ME F221 MECHANISMS AND MACHINES                         | Y Venkat Daseswara Rao .           | This has to be one of the worst courses I have ever done. The prof is really sadistic and so are the tut instructors. Do NOT pick George Yuvaraj as your tut instructor, you'll regret if you do. We had 12 surprise quizzes of 5 minutes each and 4 assignments right before our compre. The assignments weren't based on what he taught in class, but on separate videos which he uploaded on Google Classroom. He didn't teach the subject properly so most of us had to rely on the slides for midsem (which was held in CAD lab, you either get lucky and have Prof. Panigrahi evaluate your answers, or unlucky and have YVD or Yuvaraj cut marks for even the tiniest mistake) and compre. However, the grading is good if you're aiming for a B or an A-.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  ME F315 ADVANCED MANUFACTURING PROCESSES                | Narala Suresh Kumar Reddy          | It is a pretty lite course compared to Manufacturing Process as the syllabus is way more tolerable. The concepts are mostly factual so there quite a lot of rote learning present. Thing to note is it was binary marking (either full or 0) in both mids and Compre so be extra careful in calculations, Grading is standard av at B- , Make sure to practice pyqs and tuts, Important thing to note is to choose an Easy Project in Fabrication Project ( it was 5 percent weightage for us but it ll likely be increased for next batches) and complete it quickly or else it will get hectic in the end(do not wait for them to give materials either buy them or use existing ones in workshop and take the help of people there)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  ME F316 MANUFACTURING MANAGEMENT                        | Amrita Priyadarshini               | The course is very trivial, there is absolutely no need to dabble into the theoretical part. Solve PYQs and check your answers thoroughly as the correction is a bit sadistic (you'll lose all the marks if your answer is correct but have written unnecessary stuff). Compre is absolutely a game changer as it accounts for 45% of the entire course so take it seriously even if you've scored less in midsem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  ME F317 ENGINES MOTORS AND MOBILITY                     | Nandanavanam Jalaiah .             | The prof teaches well but the course structure is poorly designed. In my opinion, the theoretical part of the course should be an open-book component because there are too many things to remember (50% of the midsem paper and 40% of the compre paper were theoretical). Make sure to practice PYQs and tuts to make sure you don't lose marks in the numerical part. Grading is good if you're targeting a B.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  MGTS F316 Managerial and Leadership Skills Handout      | Raghunathan Rajasekaran            | Very nice course. It makes you rethink life choices. It had pretty good grading also but the prof would prefer you interacting in class. The course deals with ethics, integrity, trust, commitment, vision and goal setting, decision making, delegation, communication skills, interviewing skills, time management, training and development etc. We have in class activities which are very fun and engaging. You don't have to put in weekly effort for this course but before compre and mids you will have to go through a lot of content. Even though there's rote learning in the course the exams will only deal with understanding and basic definitions. Overall pretty nice course                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  PHA F211 PHARMACEUTICAL ANALYSIS                        | Balaram Ghosh                      | A very factual course. Cram all the slides as much as you can. Until you can cram no more. Then cram some more and more until you can breathe no longer. The better you cram, the better grade you get. Copy each and everything in the slides down in the notebook for the quizzes. Attend all the classes or ask for classnotes from friends occasionally to make sure you don't miss out on any information that has potential to be asked on the quiz(and every word in this course has that potentialðŸ™‚). Attend all the tuts or find answers to them. Write the solutions of them all in the notebook. It would come handy in the open book portion of the compre. The probability of a quiz to happen is after or around every 10 lectures. Thats all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  PHA F212 DISPENSING PHARMACY                            | Dharmarajan Sriram                 | This course is now known as pharmaceutical formulations 1 I think. How to ace this course? Cram everything on the slides. Down to the last word. But it helps to know the pyqs. I had a B- in midsems which I pulled to A- solely by doing the PYQs well. So do them well. If you don't understand something, ask sir really. Cram and do pyqs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  PHA F244 PHYSICAL PHARMACY                              | Venkata Vamsi Krishna Venuganti    | The course is practical based. Easy, if you connect the dots. The Professor is good at teaching the subject, but grading is a little based on how you perform in exams, attendance to class also plays a huge role. Be thorough with the lab practicals, because he might be able to frame questions based on them. Even the slightest of slightest things done during lab practicals can be asked. Be thorough with writing a proper lab manual as well, since he's very old school that way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|  PHY F341 SOLID STATE PHYSICS                            | Aravinda Narayanan Raghavan .      | The course is a nice introduction to the world of Condensed matter Physics. It also opens up your view to the applications of Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics in the field of matter Physics. Raghavan sir's classes used to have slides with a few important topics, but most of the learning was through discussions in class. Also, he takes surprise quizzes. So attending his classes is very important for this course. One interesting thing is his evaluative components were pretty innovative. He focused more on testing knowledge of concept rather than bookish, textbook-based knowledge. Grading was decent, B- on av.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
