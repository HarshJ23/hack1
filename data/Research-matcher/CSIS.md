| Dipanjan Chakraborty             | email: dipanjan@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in<br>Office: H131                                                                                       | Research Interests<br>My broad research interests lie at the intersections of Information and Communication Technologies towards Development (ICTD) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). I am currently interested in "Responsible Technologies": technologies which ensure responsible outcome for its users and for society. A lot of my current research is focused on documenting technologies which lead to irresponsible outcomes, and on sense-making of people's behaviour on online platforms.<br> <br>Potential researchers, collaborators and funders who agree that technologies should lead to responsible outcomes towards the users and society, please drop me an email at dipanjan@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in for collaboration brainstorming.<br> <br>My PhD research has mostly revolved around using technologies to improve government accountability. My thesis synopis is here and my PhD thesis can be found here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Voice Interfaces for low-literacy contexts (in partnership with GIZ and Gram Vaani)<br>Building AI-based Market Intelligence Systems for Farmer Collectives (in partnership with Google AI4Good, Gram Vaani and CCD)<br>Using Satellite Imagery for NREGA impact assessment (in partnership with Lib Tech India and FES)<br>Documenting the Digital Divides<br>Counter-Publics on Social Media (in partnership with University of Toronto)<br>UI/UX on low cost devices<br>Designing for the new users of the Internet<br>Interfaces of People, Society and the Internet (polarisation on social media, fake news, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Database Systems store important and valuable data pertaining to an organization.<br>We work on the following issues- (i) Query processing schemes which help in improving the performance of the system that leads to greater satisfaction of the user. (ii) Database Tuning is the process that involves analyzing the performance of the database system after its deployment, and applying necessary changes to schema, indexing, storage plan etc. to achieve higher performance.  (iii) Database security is need of the hour in present day Information systems, which is necessary to safeguard the sensitive and valuable data of an organization from unintended theft, updates, loss, denial of access to legitimate users etc.<br>Cloud Databases : Database as a Service is becoming a promising way to provide cloud applications with reliable and flexible database services. We propose to work on issues like- scalability and security, related to cloud database services.<br> <br>B. Data Management in Wireless Sensor Networks<br>The main focus of this  research is on the Data Management in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Due to the fact that the communication activity is a dominant source of energy consumption in a WSN, it is essential to minimize the number of messages exchanged in wireless sensor networks. The external entities submit their requests for data, to the base-station. Base-station then disseminates the query in required form to the concerned nodes in the network. The nodes respond to this and send the results back to the base-station from where it is transmitted to the external applications/users. The data extraction from nodes may be either pull-based or push-based. In the first approach, the base-station issues ad-hoc queries to nodes, and in the second approach, sensor nodes keep sending the data to the base-station according to some predefined scheme. In one of the data dissemination techniques, nodes in a network form a tree structure (routing tree) to handle query/data transmissions. There exist a number of tree-based routing schemes. Normally, the base-station is considered to be the root of the routing tree. As part of the data management in WSNs, we focus  on the following issues.<br>Efficient routing schemes to minimize transmission overheads.<br>Data compression to achieve reduced number of packets.<br>Exploit query containment to minimize the query evaluation and transmission overheads.<br>Effective and efficient data storage and retrieval schemes.<br>Distributed query evaluation.<br>Efficient user query interface to Data in WSNs. | Planning to submit a proposal on Wireless Sensor Networks Applications.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Therefore, understanding the brain ought to involve ideas and tools from Computer Science. My work aims to uncover the fundamental principles that govern computation in the brain. To this end, I build and use tools from Mathematics and Computer Science. There are also interesting new parallels between understanding the brain and understanding the workings of deep neural networks, both of which are leading to fundamental conceptual questions about the very nature of understanding computation.
