**1(A).**Consider the three amino acids; Proline; Leucine and Lysine.
During protein folding in an aqueous environment, which amino acid
minimizes its contact with water to the greatest extent. Arrange them in
order of minimizing contact with water. Which energetic term changes, to
reduce the free energy of folding? Explain.

**(B).**Is it possible to separate some molecules with no net charge? If
so how, what is the method called and how does it work.

**(C).**Arrange the following three amino acids; Glycine; Tyrosine;
Proline in decreasing order of their backbone (φ,ψ) flexibility. Give
appropriate justification.***[(5+3+5M)]{.underline}***
