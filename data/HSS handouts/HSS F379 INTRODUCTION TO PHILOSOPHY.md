**Scope and Objective of the Course:** Throughout history, science has dramatically changed the pace and mode of human life. It gained momentum during the modern era when different branches of science emerged. In addition to systematizing knowledge, these derivative scientific inquiries organized the study of worldly phenomena. It is, however, the mother of all subjects, the philosophy that has historically shaped the sense of scientific inquiry with its arguments and counter arguments. This course first examines the basics of philosophical perspectives on scientific inquiry. With this course, students will be able to recognize the questions about science and how they differ from scientific questions. It provides a clear understanding of what is distinctive about science, i.e., how it differs from other human enterprises regarding knowledge, methods, implications, and values. It enables students to understand how philosophy scrutinizes scientific theories and explanations in their attempt to unveil the causality of phenomena. It also aims to create an awareness among students about how science relates to philosophy and further make sense of the philosophical issues in different branches of science.

The course introduces students various philosophical perspectives on science in general. It mainly considers a few of the classic questions in the philosophy of science: What is it to call something a science? How does scientific reasoning work? What is the nature of scientific explanation? How do scientific theories change over time? Are scientific theories true? Is science value-free? A detailed discussions on these will enable students to understand the concern of philosophy of science, in general, and various thought provoking philosophical issues associated with different branches of science, in specific. In the end, students will be knowledgeable about the critical issues in the philosophy of science. They will find themselves comfortable discussing complex ideas and able to analyze and construct philosophical arguments concerning science
