*Course Title*			:  Postcolonial Literature** 

*Instructor-in-Charge*		:  Prof T Vijay Kumar 



**Scope and Objective of the Course:** This course, introductory in nature, seeks to help students make sense of their postcolonial context through a study of its representation in literary and theoretical texts. The course will familiarize them with the key terms, concepts, issues, debates, and theories in postcolonial writing. Students will be encouraged to reflect on and revisit received notions and canonical texts from the perspective of their lived experience. Besides equipping them with the conceptual framework and analytical tools to read the ‘signs’ in colonial, postcolonial, and nationalist discourses, the course aims to foster, through lectures, debate, discussion, and assignments, self-reflection and the spirit of critical inquiry among students.
